1.- Obtaining the source code

Source code can be obtained either by downloading the released TAR file, or 
either directly cloning from the Git source code repository at Assembla:

    git clone https://git.assembla.com/jsmapper.git


2.- Installing pre-requisites

The following compile-time dependencies are needed to build the project:

	- cmake
	- C/C++ compiler
	- distro-specific infrastructure needed to build 3rd party kernel modules
	  (in some cases this means simply installed kernel headers, in others the 
	  full kernel sources are needed)
	- libxml2 development files
	- libncurses development files 
	- libudev development files
	- gtest binary & development files

 
 3.- Compiling the project
 
 JSMapper uses CMake for the whole build process, including building the kernel 
 module that provides event filtering. Thus, the recommended way to build the 
 project is to create an out-of-the-tree build folder, then initialize it by 
 pointing to source code's "src" folder (where main CMakeLists.txt is located).
 
 Example commands:
 
   $ mkdir build 
   $ cmake <path_to_jsmapper>/src 
   $ make
