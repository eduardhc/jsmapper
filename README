1.- Introduction

JSMapper is a Linux joystick programming mapping tool designed for gamers who 
want to take full profit of advanced game devices under Linux. It allows the 
user to map keys (and key sequences) to any button and axis, while also 
supporting an arbitrary number of operating modes & shift states, based on 
button & axis positions (bands).

What makes JSMapper special is that it operates at kernel level, so it can be 
used either for games running on Linux, Windows games running under Wine, or 
even Windows games running under a VM on a Linux host.
